<p>The <a href="/heraldry/">Crane coat of arms</a> located on the Heraldry page is based on two drawings found in <em>Genealogy Of The Crane Family. Volume I</em> (frontispiece) and <em>The Cranes of Suffolk, extr. from &lsquo;The visitation of Suffolke&rsquo;</em> (page 3). Care was taken to honor these examples and follow the description outlined in the associated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazon">Blazon</a>. The illustration was first drawn in pencil then inked with India Ink. The final rendering was color corrected and saved for web with Photoshop. </p>
<p>This site uses <em>Georgia</em> and <em>Fontin</em> for typography, and was hand-coded in HTML and CSS with the use of TextWrangler on a Mac. Photos were taken by me with an iPhone, unless otherwise noted. All photos are copyright their respective owner. </p>
<p>The self portrait located in the footer of the website was painted with Procreate&reg; on an iPad Mini with my finger. </p>
